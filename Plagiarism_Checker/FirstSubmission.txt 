Project Title => Copy Detector
Roll Numbers => 153050007,153050013

Problem Description => 
 
Given a input file and directory, We have to sort all the files in directory according to closet matching index with given input file.

Closest matching index => 
 
The matching index we considered is the "Levenshtein distance" .The levenshtein distance between two strings specifies the minimum 
number of operations (insert,update,delete) to convert one string to other.
This indicates how one line of code is similar to other.

Progress till now =>
The basic framework of project is ready. FileReading, finding similarity index like functions are implemented. Now we will
be adding new features on this basic framework and finding stricter strategies for copy detection.We may consider alternative similarity
metrics for comparision if significant improvement is observed.Thanks.
